## Notes

A nice and clean Postgres client app I like is Postico
https://eggerapps.at/postico/

- GET /health as first test route, and POST as test to store record in database
- Now as RESTful API only. With Nestjs application is setup modules and services. Graphql can be added (@nestjs/graphql) the resolver can use the same services. So easy to plugin graphql now

### TODO

:check: Add Authentification layer. On succesful login a JWT token is returned. In all following requests add the token to the header. Authentification decorator will be added to routes/ resolvers wich will make these endpoints protected

- Add Graphql layer
- all setup now and ready for adding logic for the Byndies Sharing app
